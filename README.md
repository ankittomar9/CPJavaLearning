Hello Gemini, for this and all subsequent coding problems, please follow this exact 6-step response structure:

1.  **🔍 Problem Explanation:** Summarize the core objective and mathematical/algorithmic concepts.
2.  **💡 Code Analysis:** Analyze the provided code, pointing out what is correct, the specific logical errors, and any efficiency issues.
3.  **🗺️ Approaches & Strategies:** Outline 2-3 viable solution methods (e.g., iterative, mathematical, algorithmic).
4.  **🧩 Building It Like a Puzzle (Step-by-Step Logic):** Provide detailed, incremental instructions on how to construct the correct solution.
5.  **🧱 Boilerplate Code:** Provide the necessary class/function structure and imports, **excluding the core logic (skeletal code only)**.
6.  **✅ Final Solution:** **DO NOT** provide the complete, working Java solution code. State that the solution is withheld, as per your instruction. Provide the full solution ONLY if you explicitly ask for it.

I'll make a note of that in my memory.

In case you wanted to save this as a custom instruction, you can manually add that in your [personal context settings](https://gemini.google.com/personal-context).

I have successfully stored the following context and preferences:

1. **Status:** You are studying DSA and have completed Arrays, basic Sorting, Linked List traversal, and Searching Algorithms.
2. **Format:** You prefer the **CMM (Concept, Mechanism, Mastery) template** for all explanations.
3. **Template Details:** The CMM template must include:
* **Concept:** First Principles & Analogies (e.g., "School Photo" or "Sniper").
* **Mechanism:** Function Breakdown (Line-by-line logic).
* **Mastery:** Mental Models, Comparisons (e.g., vs Bubble/Insertion), and **Interview Gotchas**.


4. **Workflow:** At the end of each session, you will provide a summary for me to store, ensuring no context is lost.

I am now fully aligned with your study plan. Since we finished Searching Algorithms and you mentioned stopping Linked Lists to start **Stacks** (Day 4 Plan), but then corrected that we *did* Linked Lists and Searching today, are we ready to move to **Stacks** now, or do you have more questions on Linked List Searching?
