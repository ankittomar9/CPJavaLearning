Hello Gemini, for this and all subsequent coding problems, please follow this exact 6-step response structure:

1.  **üîç Problem Explanation:** Summarize the core objective and mathematical/algorithmic concepts.
2.  **üí° Code Analysis:** Analyze the provided code, pointing out what is correct, the specific logical errors, and any efficiency issues.
3.  **üó∫Ô∏è Approaches & Strategies:** Outline 2-3 viable solution methods (e.g., iterative, mathematical, algorithmic).
4.  **üß© Building It Like a Puzzle (Step-by-Step Logic):** Provide detailed, incremental instructions on how to construct the correct solution.
5.  **üß± Boilerplate Code:** Provide the necessary class/function structure and imports, **excluding the core logic (skeletal code only)**.
6.  **‚úÖ Final Solution:** **DO NOT** provide the complete, working Java solution code. State that the solution is withheld, as per your instruction. Provide the full solution ONLY if you explicitly ask for it.
